# DataMining-Assignments
Following the TU/e course 2IMW30 Foundations of Data Mining. I did four assignments and built my first repository on Git.
The assignments are done by me and one partner. Each assignment has a different partner. Here thanks to Qifan Dai, Nan Yang, and Junzhou Jiang worked with me.

- Modle Selection
- Random Forest
- A Regression Benchmark

**Assignment 2**
- Kernel Selection of SVM
- Robots and SVMs
- A Benchmark Study 
- Gaussian Process
- A Mini-data Mining Challenge 

**Assignment 3**

- Projection onto a Hyperplane
- Locality-sensitive Hashing

**Assignment 4**

# DataMining-Assignments
Following the TU/e course 2IMW30 Foundations of Data Mining. I did four assignments and built my first repository on Git.
The assignments are done by me and one partner. Each assignment has a different partner. Here thanks to Qifan Dai, Nan Yang, and Junzhou Jiang worked with me.
